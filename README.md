Camera Input → Image Processing Unit: The camera captures real-time images and sends them to the image processing unit for traffic sign analysis.

Image Processing Unit → AR Rendering Engine: Once a sign is identified, the data is sent to the AR rendering engine to overlay the sign's information on the user's real-world view.

AR Rendering Engine → User Interface (UI): The AR-enhanced view with recognized signs is displayed to the user through the interface.

Environmental Adaptation Unit → Image Processing Unit: The environmental adaptation unit supplies data, such as lighting conditions, to the image processing unit to enhance sign recognition accuracy.
